# Installation

There are two methods to get up and running with Robase.  
It is recommended to install `RobaseService` into `ReplicatedStorage` or if you have a folder dedicated to packages or opensource modules, then that is even better. You can install it wherever you wish though.

## Method A: Roblox Model (via Roblox Studio)

!!! stop "Caution"
    Roblox Models can be outdated, the suggested installation method is Method B.

!!! todo
    Write documentation for Roblox Model.

## Method B: Filesystem (via Rojo)
+ Go to the [Github Releases](https://github.com/Arvoria/Robase-2.0.0/releases) and download the latest stable release of RobaseService. Save it somewhere meaningful so you only need to download it once.

+ Open your working directory in your preferred IDE and unzip the RobaseService zip folder into ReplicatedStorage or wherever you desire.

+ Use [Rojo](https://rojo.space) to sync your files into Roblox Studio from your IDE.
